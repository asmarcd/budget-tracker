  ## Link to Application
  <a href = "https://immense-hollows-66569.herokuapp.com/">Click here to test the app for yourself</a>

  ## Description
  
This app allows you to track income and expenses over time so you can better manage your budget. It works online and off, and changes persist across both, so you can install it on your phone as an app, or use it in the browser.

  ## Installation
  
Making use of the app requires no special installations. If you want to edit the code for your own testing, you should run npm install to bring in the relevant NPM packages, which are:

* compression
* express
* lite-server
* mongoose
* morgan
  
  ## Usage
  
Simply navigate to the deployed website and start tracking your income and expenses. You can name each item, choose the amount, and choose if you want to add or deduct it from your budget. This will update your total and your chart over time.
